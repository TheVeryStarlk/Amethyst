# Amethyst
A fast light-weight implementation of the Minecraft: Java edition protocol.

## Introduction
Amethyst is an extensible, customizable and easy to use Minecraft server software that is designed for mini-games servers, it sacrifices many of the vanilla mechanics in favor of performance and memory usage.

## Usage
An example of Amethyst's plugin API is available [here](https://github.com/TheVeryStarlk/Amethyst/tree/master/Amethyst.Plugin). 
Be careful that the current [API](https://github.com/TheVeryStarlk/Amethyst/tree/master/Amethyst.Api) is subject to change as Amethyst develops.
